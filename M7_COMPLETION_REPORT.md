## üìÅ Deliverables

### 1. Settings Management Router

**File**: `backend/app/api/routers/settings.py` (NEW, 213 lines)

**Purpose**: Provides API endpoints for application configuration management.

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/settings` - Retrieve current settings
- `PATCH /api/settings` - Update settings (partial)
- `POST /api/settings/reset` - Reset to defaults
- `GET /api/settings/validate` - Validate settings

**Key Features**:
```python
# Response includes 35+ configuration parameters:
# - Subtitle & Translation Pipeline settings
# - Model configuration (MT model, ASR model)
# - Resource limits (concurrent tasks, upload size)
# - Feature flags (auto-scan, auto-pull, metrics)
# - System info (environment, DB vendor, storage backend)
```

**Validation Logic**:
```python
# Settings validation checks:
# - Required languages not empty
# - Task limits >= 1
# - Reasonable timeout values
# - Batch size within bounds
# - Line length within display limits
```

**Schema**: `backend/app/schemas/settings.py` (NEW, 104 lines)
- `SettingsResponse` - Full settings with 35+ fields
- `SettingsUpdateRequest` - Partial update schema with validation

---

### 2. Job Management Enhancements

**File**: `backend/app/api/routers/jobs.py` (UPDATED, +188 lines)

**New Endpoints**:

#### POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/cancel

**Purpose**: Cancel a running or queued translation job.

**Logic**:
```python
# Cancel workflow:
# 1. Verify job exists and is cancellable
# 2. Revoke Celery task with SIGTERM
# 3. Update job status to "cancelled"
# 4. Log cancellation event
```

**Error Handling**:
- 404: Job not found
- 409: Job already completed/cancelled/failed

#### POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/retry

**Purpose**: Retry a failed or cancelled translation job.

**Logic**:
```python
# Retry workflow:
# 1. Verify original job exists and is retryable
# 2. Create new job with same parameters
# 3. Submit to appropriate Celery queue (translate/asr)
# 4. Return new job ID
```

**Error Handling**:
- 404: Original job not found
- 409: Job is not failed/cancelled

**ASR Pipeline Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE (M4 comment was outdated):
elif request.source_type in ("audio", "media"):
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED,
        detail="ASR pipeline not yet implemented (M4 milestone)",
    )

# AFTER:
elif request.source_type in ("audio", "media"):
    from app.workers.tasks import asr_then_translate_task
    task = asr_then_translate_task.apply_async(
        args=[str(job.id)],
        queue="asr",
        priority=request.priority,
    )
```

---

### 3. Router Registration

**File**: `backend/app/main.py` (UPDATED)

**Changes**:
```python
# Added settings router import
from app.api.routers import health, models, upload, jobs, jellyfin, settings

# Added settings router registration
app.include_router(settings.router)
```

**Complete Router List** (6 routers):
1. `health` - Health checks and system status
2. `models` - Ollama model management
3. `upload` - File upload handling
4. `jobs` - Job creation and monitoring
5. `jellyfin` - Jellyfin integration
6. `settings` - Configuration management ‚ú® NEW

---

### 4. SSE Progress Publishing Verification

**File**: `backend/app/workers/tasks.py` (VERIFIED)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented across all task types

**Progress Publishing Points**:

#### Translation Task (`translate_subtitle_task`)
- Model pull progress (streaming with percentage)
- Translation progress per target language
- Writeback progress

#### ASR + Translation Task (`asr_then_translate_task`)
- Audio extraction progress (5-20%)
- ASR transcription progress (20-50%)
- Translation progress (50-80%)
- Writeback progress (80-95%)
- Completion (100%)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# Progress publishing with Redis + SSE
run_async(event_publisher.publish_job_progress(
    job_id=job_id,
    phase="mt",  # or "pull", "asr", "extract", "writeback"
    status="Translating to zh-CN",
    progress=75.5,
    completed=10,
    total=20,
))

# Frontend receives via EventSource:
# event: progress
# data: {"phase":"mt","status":"Translating to zh-CN","progress":75.5,...}
```

## üîç Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Settings Management Architecture

**Decision**: Runtime settings updates via PATCH with in-memory modification

**Rationale**:
- Allows configuration changes without container restart
- Preserves environment variables as source of truth
- Reset endpoint reloads from environment

**Trade-offs**:
- Some settings (database, Redis) require restart to take effect
- Settings don't persist between container restarts
- Frontend needs to clearly indicate which settings require restart

**Implementation**:
```python
# Update settings in memory
for field, value in updated_fields.items():
    setattr(settings, field, value)

# Reset by reloading from environment
new_settings = Settings()
for field in new_settings.model_fields:
    setattr(settings, field, getattr(new_settings, field))
```

### 2. Job Cancellation Strategy

**Decision**: Use Celery `revoke()` with `terminate=True` and `SIGTERM`

**Rationale**:
- Graceful termination allows cleanup
- Task can catch signal and update job status
- Prevents orphaned processes

**Implementation**:
```python
celery_app.control.revoke(
    task_id,
    terminate=True,
    signal="SIGTERM",
)
```

### 3. Job Retry Design

**Decision**: Create new job instead of reusing failed job

**Rationale**:
- Preserves failure history for debugging
- Clean separation between attempts
- Easier to track retry relationships

**Benefits**:
- Failed job remains in database with error details
- New job starts fresh with queued status
- Can retry multiple times without confusion

### 4. ASR Pipeline Integration

**Decision**: Remove 501 error and directly call `asr_then_translate_task`

**Rationale**:
- M4 milestone was completed
- Task implementation verified in tasks.py
- Frontend expects this to work

**Impact**:
- Users can now create ASR jobs via `/api/jobs/translate`
- Full pipeline: media ‚Üí audio ‚Üí ASR ‚Üí translation ‚Üí writeback

## üéì Lessons Learned

### 1. Importance of API Completeness Verification

**Issue**: Integration tests referenced endpoints that didn't exist (cancel, retry, settings)

**Learning**: Always verify API contracts against frontend expectations before considering backend "complete"

**Solution**: Created verification phase at start of M7

### 2. Outdated Code Comments

**Issue**: Found M4 comment saying "ASR not yet implemented" even though M4 was completed

**Learning**: Clean up milestone markers and placeholder comments after completion

**Solution**: Removed 501 error and implemented proper ASR task calling

### 3. Documentation Placement

**Issue**: `docs/` directory was read-only, couldn't create DEPLOYMENT.md there

**Learning**: Understand project structure and permissions before creating files

**Solution**: Created documentation in project root (DEPLOYMENT.md, QUICKSTART.md)

## üìù Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments

If upgrading from M6 to M7:

1. **Update code**:
   ```bash
   git pull
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **No database migrations required** (no schema changes)

3. **New environment variables**: None required (all settings have defaults)

4. **API Changes**:
   - 6 new endpoints added (backward compatible)
   - No breaking changes to existing endpoints

5. **Verify new functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Test settings endpoint
   curl http://localhost/api/settings

   # Test job cancellation (replace JOB_ID)
   curl -X POST http://localhost/api/jobs/JOB_ID/cancel
   ```
